    "- so thats really it - theres no hidden bells or whistles to a DataFrame - it just is what it is - if you are wondering why you do not just use numpy for this - like numpy can deal with the two-dimensional arrays as well - the key thing with numpy is that numpy is really efficient at dealing with two-dimensional arrays - but two-dimensional arrays where every element in the two-dimensional array - irrespective of where it is and what column or what row - numpy likes all of the data in one array to be of the same type - so it has to be all floats - or all strings or all whatever - so in this case - mixing a string column with four floating point columns - so i need to use something like pandas - or else going to have a headache if i try to use something like numpy - so thats reading datasets in with pandas - you can see its very simple - pandas makes is easy - and it knows how to interact nicely with Jupiter so that it prints them out nicely [\n",

    "- one of the big problems people have when they access their DataFrame using this sort of notation is that they go in and try and change values in their DataFrame - so lets say in your DataFrame - you want to take the average - sepal_length - within the dataset away from each of the individual values - common operation that you do - it means that then when you take the average of the column - the average comes out as zero - because you are effectively taking the average away from every value in the column - if you use this notation to do it - you will find that your values do not actually change in the DataFrame - and its to do with in the background - sometimes pandas will take a - copy - of the DataFrame when you ask it to do a subselection - and sometimes it will actually take the DataFrame - and the real problem here is the double square brackets after the - df - so because of the technical issues surrounding that - pandas provides for every DataFrame two ways into your DataFrame - methods - loc - iloc - both use the square bracket notation [\n",

    "> ~~have a look at my boolean select - or my boolean comparison in any case - and you will see that the value is true - because species is a tosa for the first 50 rows - and for all of the other rules - even though you cannot see some of them - you will just have to take my word for it - its false - so what i have gotten back here is a day series - or you can think of it as a DataFrame - still indexed by zero all the way up to 149 - so they are the labels for the rows and the original DataFrame - and the new DataFrame that i have gotten back after doing this comparison - is it has a single column - and - and the column contains either a true or false value - and its true for all of the rows with labelled with these labels here - and its true for all of the rows and with labels between zero and 49 - and false for all the other ones - so thats somewhat interesting - i suppose - you are getting a new DataFrame back with a column containing true and false values - but you can now use this returned data series or DataFrame - and to find all of the rows where this column says true - and ignore all the rows where its false~~ [\n",
